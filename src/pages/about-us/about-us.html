	       <b id="aboutUsTitle"> Retailer Overview of FDA Regulations for Selling Tobacco Products</b>
           
              
               The FDA regulates tobacco products—including cigarettes, smokeless tobacco, e-cigarettes/vapes, cigars, hookah tobacco, and pipe tobacco, among others—to protect the public from the harms of tobacco use. FDA regulations make it illegal to sell tobacco products to minors. Retailers who sell tobacco products must comply with FDA’s regulations, including:
               
              
                 <ul> 
                  <li > Not selling tobacco products to anyone under the age of 18 </li>
                 
                  <li > Checking the photo ID of everyone under age 27 who attempts to purchase tobacco products</li>

                 </ul>
              Retailers are also responsible for following any state or local tobacco laws, even if they are more restrictive.
              The complete list of FDA’s tobacco laws can be found on the FDA website at
